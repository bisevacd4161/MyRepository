# About Me
Hi, welcome to my repository! First, here's a little about me; I'm really interested in becoming proficient in GitHub, working on making playoffs with my basketball team, and my favorite hobby is crafting!

My favorite color is red, but the more maroon scale of it. Aesthetics are fun to work with and I hope to make really beautiful projects in my Exploring Computer Science class.

That's all for now, thank you!
